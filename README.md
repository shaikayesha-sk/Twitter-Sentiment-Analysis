## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a key application of NLP, allowing us to extract subjective information from text data. This project leverages various machine learning techniques to analyze the sentiment of tweets, providing valuable insights into public opinion on different topics.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the code in this repository:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect tweets using the Twitter API.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected data.
3. **Model Training**: Train the sentiment analysis model.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model.

## Data Collection

From kaggle i collected resources 

## Data Preprocessing

Preprocess the collected tweets by:
- Removing special characters, URLs, and hashtags
- Converting text to lowercase
- Tokenizing and stemming words

## Model Training

Train the sentiment analysis model using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or LSTM. Save the trained model for future use.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Use a separate validation dataset to ensure unbiased evaluation.

## Results

The trained sentiment analysis model achieved an accuracy of 91%. This high level of accuracy indicates the model's effectiveness in classifying tweet sentiments accurately.
